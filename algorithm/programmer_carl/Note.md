# Note for Learning Programmer Carl Algorithm

## 1. Array

**Knoweldge Points**: `principle of cyclic invariants`, `double pointers`, `fast and slow pointers`, `std::vector<>::reserve() and std::vector<>::resize()`,  `sliding window`, `prefix sum`

### 1. Basics

1. `Array` is stored continuously in memory.

### 2. Binary Search

1. For `mid`, the standard approach is to **round down**: `int mid = left + (right - left) / 2` because if we use round down, it may lead to endless loop (I don't really know the mathematical reason).

2. For `boundary checking`, we need to focus on the **Principle of cyclic invariants**, which is the **invariant definition of interval** in this case.

    Specifically, there are **three** aspects: the initial values of `left` and `right`, the `condition of the while loop`, and the `update of left and right`.

    We can fix `left` and classify based on `right`, i.e., `[left, right]` and `[left, right)`.

    For example, if we choose `[left, right]`, we have: 

    ```c++
    int main()
    {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.size() - 1;
        
        while (left < right)
        {
            //...
            {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
            {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    If we don't make these three aspects consistent, we may also walk towards to endless loop.

### 3. Remove Elements in Place

1. The `slow pointer` mark the place which need to be replaced and the `fast pointer` find the next number which can be put to the place marked by the `slow pointer` and after replacement, they move together.

### 4. Sorted Squares

1. The difference between `std::vector<>::reserve()`  and `std::vector<>::resize()`.
2. Think carefully where the `pointers` start from.

### 5. Minimum Length of Sub-array

1. `sliding window` can also be represented by `double pointers`.
2. The key points of `sliding window` is what the **content** inside of the window is and how to **move the starting and ending positions**.

### 6. Generate Spiral Matrix

1. `Principle of cyclic invariants`:

    1. the upper row from left to right

    2. the right column from top to bottom

    3. the bottm row from right to left

    4. the left column from bottom to top

    5. if we choose `left closed right open interval`: 

        ```c++
        for (int col = loop; col < n - loop - 1; col++)
        ```

        if we choose `left closed right closed interval`: 

        ```c++
        for (int col = loop; col <= n - loop - 1 - 1; col++)
        ```

### 7. Interval Sum

1. `Prefix sum` can help us handle interval problems.

### 8. Buy Land

1. This is essentially an interval problem and we can use `Prefix sum` to solve it.

## 2. Linked List

**Knowledge Points**: `dummy node`, `double pointers`, `fast and slow pointers`

### 1. Basics

1. Variants: `Single Linked List`, `Doubly Linked List`, `Cyclic Linked List`
2. Operations: `delete node`, `add node`.
3. `Complexity comparison` between `array` and `linked list`.

### 2. Remove Elements

1. `Dummy node` can help use handle nodes in a uniform way.
2. Remember to `delete` the `dummy node` or other nodes we add for simplicity if needed.

### 3. Custom Linked List

1. `Dummy node` can help **insert** node **before** a node whose index is given.
2. Using a variable `m_Length` to record the current **length** of the linked list can simply the code.

### 4. Reverse List

1. `Double pointers`: `pre` and `cur` in this case, besides `next` is used to temporarily record `cur->next`.
2. Notice the **order** of updating the two pointers.
3. `Recursion` can also be used to solve this problem.

### 5. Swap Pairs

1. `Dummy node` can help us handle nodes in a uniform way, e.g., special judgement of the `head node` or some special cases like whether there is one or two nodes left in this problem.

### 6. Remove the N-th node from end

1. `Dummy node` can help us **remove** nodes.
2. `Fast and slow pointers`: the fast pointer firstly move `n` steps and then the two pointers move together until the fast pointer arrives at the end, and now the slow pointer is pointing to the `n-th` node from end. Please notice that this is just a rough description and in the real code we may need to use `dummy node`, decide how many steps the fast pointer should actually move, and hot to end the co-move.

### 7. Get Intersection Node

1. `Fast and slow pointers`: the fast pointer firstly move forward to make the left length of the current linked list be equal to the length of the other linked list, which is shorter.

### 8. Detect Cycle

1. `Fast and slow pointers`: the fast pointers moves `2` steps at each time, while the slow pointer moves `1` step at each time and finally they will meet in the cycle if there is a cycle. (Note that there comes to some math.)

## 3. Hash Table

**Knowledge Points**: `array, set, map` are all `hash tables`, `prune`, `addition overflow`

### 1. Basics

1. `Hash table`: a data structure that is directly accessed based on the value of a key.
2. `Hash function`: map the `key` to the `index`.
3. `Hash collison`: we can use `zipper method`, `linear detection method`, `double hashed method`, etc. to solve this problem.
4. Common form: `array`, `set`, and `map`.
5. `Hash table` can help us quickly find whether an element has appeared or not at the cost of additional space expenses.

### 2. Is Anagram

1. There are only lowercase letters in this problem, meaning we know the exact maximum size in advance, so we can just use `array` not `map` to solve it.
2. Learn to handle data in just **one** `hash table` if possible.

### 3. Intersection

1. As we don't know the possible maximum size in advance, we need to use `set`. (Note that `set` needs more space and time (hash function needs time) than `array` does.)
2. `std::unordered_set` can be constructed based on a given `std::vector`, vice versa.

### 4. Happy Number

### 5. Sum of Two Numbers

### 6. Add Four Numbers

### 7. Ransom Letter

### 8. Sum of Three Numbers

1. No need to use `hash table`, use `double pointers`.
2. We can `prune` to make it faster.

### 9. Sum of Four Numbers

1. There are two classes of `pruning` in this problem.
2. Notice the problem of `addition overflow`.
